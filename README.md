# Resolving-Occlusion-Challenge-in-Early-YOLO-Versions-Object-Detection-Issues

Comparing different versions of YOLO (You Only Look Once) for helium-induced bubble detection in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs of ion-irradiated iron chromium steel serves multiple purposes:
first, it assesses algorithm performance variations to identify which version is most effective at detecting these bubbles. 
second, it allows for the optimization of detection algorithms for challenging scenarios. 
third, by determining which version is more resource-efficient, computational resources can be used optimally. 
Staying updated with the latest YOLO versions ensures the use of improved technology. Ultimately, this comparison safeguards the validity and reliability of research findings in materials science and nuclear engineering.
Furthermore, the trained ML model from this work will be directly integrated into the TIBML (Tennessee Ion Beam Lab at UTK), creating an AI-integrated lab with advanced capabilities for material characterization under extreme conditions. Through this AI integration, TIBML will have the capability to analyze these defects at a nano-scale level while the samples are undergoing annealing, irradiation, and visualization through TEM.
This repository can be used to directly apply different YOLO codes version (1 to 7) on microscopy imaging containing radiation defects such as helium bubbles. 
Note that the single file yolod_SA is based on darknet and contains YOLO V!, V2 and V3 version.
